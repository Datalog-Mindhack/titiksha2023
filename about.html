              Titiksha has been an example in achieving huge feats with unparalleled figures ever since its inception in 2008. Titiksha has grown in stature in terms of its content, infrastructure and logistics. The overwhelming crowd of such a high magnitude and a world-class technological display along with a tinge of enjoyment has made our dream a technological extravaganza. With such vastness and diversity, the hospitality of the guests is of paramount importance. We, at Titiksha, constantly strive towards the satisfaction of everyone. We shall leave no stone unturned in fulfilling the needs of a secure accommodation away from home. Along with accommodation facilities for our participants, we also set up a cafeteria serving a variety of cuisines satisfying the needs of every palate. We strive to make your stay comfortable and your experience, a memorable one. <br><br>

              We are organizing our annual TechFest at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (SMVDU) in Jammu and Kashmir in the month of January, 2023. Established under the JAMMU AND KASHMIR SHRI MATA VAISHNO DEVI ACT, 1999, an Act of J&K state legislature (Act No. XII of 1999 dated 12 th May 1999) SMVDU is an autonomous, highly technical & fully residential university. The University started functioning as an academic unit in Aug 2004 when it was inaugurated on 19 th August 2004 by the former Honorable president of India, Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam and has been attaining higher levels of excellence each passing day. We have had the privilege of being graced by the presence of dignitaries like Dr. Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister of India), Sh. Narendra Modi (Honorable Prime Minister of India), Sh. Ram Nath Kovind (Honorable President of India), Dr Subhramanian Swamy (Eminent Economist and MP) among others. On behalf of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra it gives me great pleasure to introduce “TITIKSHA 2023” our Annual Technical Festival of its kind in North India, which witnesses a multidimensional congregation of young technocrats, from not only inside the state, but pan India. TITIKSHA is to be conducted during the month of January, 2023 & will envelop various innovative and unexplored technical fields in association with the challenging and interesting events which include Technical and Non-Technical events from various departments as well as Entrepreneurial, Technical and Inspirational talks by eminent personalities. In addition to Technical Events, we will be having a Game Zone, Adventure Zone and a musical concert. We are also organizing an International Conference on Recent Trends and Advancements in Engineering and Technology parallel to the fest. More than 30 institutions from Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Delhi, Uttarakhand etc. have been invited. <br><br>

              We expect a footfall of 5000 people only from J&K and attendees from around India are still counting, in the festival. Team TITIKSHA is also planning to organise a road rally beginning from Jammu and it will finish upon reaching its final destination- SMVDU. It is aimed at supporting the general cause of spreading information and making people aware about the dangers of drug abuse both to the individual and the society. And a great number of students will be participating and it will also have media coverage. So, in this way this is also going to benefit our sponsors as the students will be carrying the logos of the sponsors in their t-shirts and banners. Thus, this will help in theadvertising and brand promotion.The panorama of our grand event will gather the assimilation of not only Jammu and Kashmir, but the gist of all India. We look forward to embark as association with your firm to a journey of ultimate success in TITIKSHA 2023.
